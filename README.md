# Compiler and VM for Alpha lang (JS-like programming language).

## Alpha Compiler

to compile the Compiler run:
```bash
make compiler
```

to clean binary/object files associated with the compiler and also any files generated by lex or yacc:
```bash
make clean_compiler
```

to compile an Alpha source file run:
```bash
alphac <alpha_source_file>
```
once compilation is finished the compiler will generate 5 files which can be found in the 'output' dirctory

- rules.out: contains the order of grammar resolutions that happen during the parsing of the file
- symtab_buckets.out/symtab_scopes.out: contains the symbol table organized by bucket/scope corespondingly
- quads.aic: contains the quads that have been generated from the parser
- target_code.atc: contains binary file information in readable format
- and lastly the binary file which can be found in the root directory of the program.

## Alpha Virtual Machine 

to compile the Virtual Machine run:
```bash
make vm
```

to clean binary/object files associated with the virtual Machine run:
```bash
make clean_vm
```

to execute a binary file in the VM run:
```bash
alpha <alpha_binary_file.abc>
```
