This is Compiler and VM is build for a JS-like programming language called Alpha.

-=-=- Alpha Compiler -=-=- 
    
    > run 'make compiler' to compile the Compiler
    
    > run 'make clean_compiler' to clean binary/object files associated with the compiler and also any files
      generated by lex or yacc
    
    > run 'alphac' and pass as an argument an alpha source code file to compile it.
      once compilation is finished the compiler will generate 5 files which can be found in the 'output' dirctory

        -rules.out: contains the order of grammar resolutions that happen during the parsing of the file
        -symtab_buckets.out/symtab_scopes.out: contains the symbol table organized by bucket/scope corespondingly
        -quads.aic: contains the quads that have been generated from the parser
        -target_code.atc: contains binary file information in readable format

      and lastly the binary file which can be found in the root directory of the program.

    > run 'make vm' to compile the Virtual Machine

    > run 'make clean_vm' to clean binary/object files associated with the virtual Machine

    > run 'alpha' and pass as an argument an alpha binary file (.abc)
